The the thesis submitted to XIDIAN UNIVERSITY for the degree of Master,  
the main content of this thesis is summarized as follows:

The first part focuses on solving the problem of abuse using of running  
memory when computing suffix array,we develop a lightwight construction  
DCV,the result is comparative with LS.

In the second part,we develop two practical CSA structuress,called Gam-CSA  
and Adaptive-CSA.We partion the gap sequence of Phi array into blocks and  
use gamma coding,data-aware coding for Gam-CSA and Adaptive-CSA respectively.  
Experiments show significant advantages over other CSAs,including

In the last part,we designe an efficient FM-index,called Adaptive-FM,use  
a versatile structure,i.e.,WT(wavelet tree).The BitMap within WT is parted  
into blocks and using data-aware rank for each block, just like the way in  
Adaptive-CSA.Experiments show significant advantages,especially in space.
